Postmortem Report: The Great Database Meltdown of 2024
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start: June 1, 2024, 14:00 UTC
End: June 1, 2024, 16:30 UTC

Impact:
Our e-commerce platform was significantly affected, with around 70% of users experiencing slow page loads, timeouts, and failed transactions.

Root Cause:
A misconfigured database query led to a full table scan, causing an overwhelming load on the database server and resulting in high latency and timeouts.

Timeline
14:00 UTC: Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high latency on the database server.
14:05 UTC: On-call engineer began investigating the alert.
14:15 UTC: Engineer assumed a network issue and checked network logs and connectivity.
14:30 UTC: Customer complaints about slow page loads and failed transactions started coming in.
14:45 UTC: Investigation focused on the application servers, checking for CPU/memory spikes.
15:00 UTC: Database team was brought in to examine query performance and database health.
15:15 UTC: Misconfigured query identified; performing a full table scan instead of using indexes.
15:30 UTC: Temporary fix applied by killing the offending query and restarting the database server.
16:00 UTC: Verified that performance returned to normal, monitoring continued.
16:30 UTC: Incident officially declared resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution
Detailed Cause:
A recent update to our product search functionality included a new database query that lacked proper indexing. This oversight led to full table scans. As user search requests increased, the database load spiked, causing significant performance degradation and eventual timeouts.

Detailed Fix:
The database team identified the problematic query and implemented an index on the relevant table columns. They also optimized the query to ensure it utilized the new indexes efficiently. After applying these changes, the query execution time reduced significantly, restoring normal database performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Code Reviews: Tighten the code review process to ensure queries are optimized before deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring: Set up alerts for long-running queries and unusual database loads.
Performance Testing: Regularly test performance to catch bottlenecks before they impact users.
Task List:

Patch Application Code: Review and optimize all database queries in the recent update.
Add Database Indexes: Ensure all new queries have appropriate indexes.
Update Monitoring: Configure alerts for long-running queries and unusual database load.
Performance Testing: Implement a regular performance testing schedule for the database and application.
Training: Conduct training sessions for developers on database optimization techniques.
Documentation: Update internal documentation to include best practices for writing efficient database queries.

Final Thoughts
Remember, a happy database is a happy user base. Let's keep our queries sharp and our indexes plentiful. Until next time, stay optimized!
